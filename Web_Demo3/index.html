			<h2> About </h2>

			<h3>Natural Travels</h3>
			<p>We have all felt it: the uncanny sensation of clear-headedness and relief that comes from a long walk in the woods, a climb to a mountain overlook, or a stroll on the beach. Even a quick dive into cool ocean surf can do it; you emerge feeling somehow cleaner despite being covered in salt water and brine. It turns out there is a heap of science behind that sensation, enough to encourage the use of our precious vacation time to immerse ourselves in nature travel for extended periods.</p>

			<h3>Wildlife</h3>
			<p>Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities. </p>

			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			
			<p>As the pace of life accelerates, everyone's life begins to become busy, but people ignore the beautiful scenery around them. Therefore we hope that people can experience as much scenery as possible around them for a limited time.While you are watching wildlife and nature with your friends or family, you can also learn some new knowledge. This will make your travel more meaningful, which is the difference between this type of travel and other types.  Finally, We hope that more and more can learn more about natural plants and animals!</p>
