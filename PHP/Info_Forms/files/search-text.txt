This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far, and seen too much, to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force. Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time. The General. To me, she's royalty. 

Destroyed? Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands. They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage. Poe! Poe! Poe!!! POE! POE!!! POE!!! Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must. How capable are your soldiers, General? I won't have you question my methods. 

We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Alright, Chewie, get ready. And Now! I AM PULLING UP!!! I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees! Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert. Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to-- Han Solo. The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. 

Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before? Yeah. Twice! What was the second time? Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. Nowhere left for you to hide. That BB unit. 

That's where. No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! I got to get to my droid before the First Order does! What - a droid?! That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind. I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important! This one is, pal. We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die! That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker! Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning. 

NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! This? Yes! Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? None of your business, THAT'S WHY! ...That can't be good. -- No it can't be -- Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. 

It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? He was captured. by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed. Poe didn't make it. 

I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run. You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen. 

I went back to the only thing I was ever good at. We both did. We lost our son, forever. No. 

Forget the droid. We have what we need. Pull back the tree line! NO!! REY!!! No, no, no, no. REY!! He took her! Did you see that? He took her. 

I know all about waiting. For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on. 

Sir, the villagers. Kill them all. On my command! Fire! Nothing here. Go ahead! All right. 

Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives. Now you tell me? No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. I did miss you. It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good. 

NO! Begin charging the weapon! Yes, sir. Weapon charging. The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report. They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself. 

You're welcome. So, fugitives, huh? The First Order wants the map. Finn is with the Resistance. . I'm just a scavenger. Let's see whatcha got.
